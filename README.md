# Rehan Hossain | Climate Scientist

A minimalist, fast personal website for a climate scientist focused on subseasonal variability (BSISO/MJO) and the Indian Summer Monsoon.

## Quick start (GitHub Pages)

1. Rename your repository to **`YOURUSERNAME.github.io`** (or create one).
2. Copy these files to the repo root and commit.
3. In GitHub: *Settings → Pages* → Source: **Deploy from a branch** → Branch: **main** (or your default).
4. Your site will be live at `https://YOURUSERNAME.github.io/`.

## Customize

- Edit `index.html`, `research.html`, `publications.html`, `contact.html`.
- Replace placeholder links (Google Scholar/ORCID/GitHub) in `publications.html`.
- Swap `/assets/img/bsiso_placeholder.svg` with a schematic or a figure.
- Optional: add a `CNAME` file if you have a custom domain.
